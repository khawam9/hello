					<h1>Inverted Can Test Diagnostic Sensor </br> Co-op</h1>

					<h2>The Problem</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Rotary cuff tears patients are diagnosed by surgeons to determine if they need surgery. During my co-op in Edmonton, </br> 
				 I learned that many patients from rural parts of Alberta would have to skip days at work and </br> 
			    travel extensively to visit the doctor, leading to a costly, time consuming visit. Sometimes, after months on the waitlist </br>
				the diagnosis would result in no surgery being needed but rather therapy, which could have begun weeks ago. </p>

				<p> The Inverted Can Test is a test used by surgeons to determine the severity of the shoulder injury and is based on their expertise and years of experience. </p>

				<header>
					<h2>The Solution</h2>
				</header>

				<p> Our team at the lab partnered with a surgeon to replicate the test, by collecting data while the test is being performed. </br>
					Through a combination of force sensors, accelerometers, and an ESP32, the data analysis picked up on relevant indicators.  </br>
				 </p>

					<h2>Mechanical Design</h2>
				</header>
				<!-- Lists -->
				<p>I led the design and development of the printed circuit board's housing unit as well as the </br>
				overall device design. The design needed to be small, easily grippable and a sleekness drawn from the Magic Mouse </br>
				as inspiration.</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-6 col-6-small">
						<h3>What I did</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>I conducted design interviews with the surgeon as well as non physicians to understand user needs both at an expert and high level</li>
							<li>Used Autodesk Inventor, Fusion360 and Bambu to design and print 3D models</li>
							<li>Used DFM principles to speed up prototyping time. Delivered an average of 1 complete prototype per week. </li>
							<li>Researched different hand held devices and hand grips for optimal ergonomics</li>
							<li>Used a multitude of design mediums such as sketching, clay and 3D scanners and the Double Diamond approach to design</li>
						</ul>

				<p>While in this role, I was also able to branch out and learn other skills such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>PCB design using EasyEda, learned how to connect wires through vias</li>
					<li>Visited different labs to select the correct silicone biomaterial padding under the device</li>
